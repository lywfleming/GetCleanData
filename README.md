## GetCleanData

The purpose of this repos is to satisfy the project assignment for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Johns Hopkins University.

Data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset was downloaded, manipulated, and saved to a file for purposes of demonstrating the ability to store data in a more readable format and to document the content and steps performed for future data analysis.

The above mentioned data set can be found here:
